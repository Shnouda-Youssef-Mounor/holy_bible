# holy_bible
A Flutter app for reading the Bible in 282+ languages. A simple and open-source Bible reading app that supports over 282 languages.

🔹 Why such a large number? Because many languages have multiple versions or editions of the Bible (e.g., modern translations, traditional versions, study editions, etc.). So, the number of Bible versions is higher than the number of languages.

🎯 Key Features:

Support for 282+ languages.

Clean and user-friendly interface.

Ability to load multiple versions per language.

Built with Flutter – works on both Android and iOS.

🛠️ Developer Friendly: This project is built using Flutter with clean code architecture and can serve as a solid starting point for similar apps.
